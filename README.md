This repository contains a reproducible Snakemake pipeline for analyzing dual RNA-seq data from *Glycine max* (soybean) following infection by the fungal pathogen, *Alternaria alternata*. The project aims to identify defense responses in soybean and virulence mechanisms in the pathogen across three post-inoculation time points (1dpi, 7dpi, and 14dpi). This work is part of my MSc thesis research at Brandon University.

## üìä Project Overview
*Alternaria alternata* is a fungal pathogen that causes leaf spot disease in soybean, resulting in considerable yield loss. Yet, the gene expression changes it induces in soybean are not completely understood. This project uses a multi-omics approach to unravel these plant-pathogen interactions.

**Key Goals:**
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in soybean during infection.
- Characterize the expression of virulence factors and effector genes in *A. alternata*.
- Understand the metabolic reprogramming of both organisms during infection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup
1. **Snakemake** are best installed via the [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). It is recommended to install **conda** via **Miniforge**. To install run:
 ```bash
 conda create -c conda-forge -c bioconda -c nodefaults --name snakemake snakemake
 conda activate snakemake
 ```

2. **Install Git**: If you don't have git, install it first. For Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, Mint use:
 ```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```

3.  **Clone the repository:**
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Achukwunta/soybean-alt-rnaseq.git
 cd soybean-alt-rnaseq
 ```

4. **Download Reference Data:**  
Reference genomes and annotations from Ensembl must be downloaded and placed in the `resources/` directory. The `config.yml` file expects them at specific paths. See the **Data Sources** section below.

5.  **Create and activate the Conda environment:**
Install any required dependencies from `environment.yml` if you're not using **conda** to install everything initially:
 ```bash
 conda env create -f environment.yml
 conda activate soybean-alt-rnaseq
 ```

## üöÄ Running the Pipeline
The pipeline is managed with Snakemake. You need to first install:
```bash
#run the full analysis with:
snakemake --cores all --use-conda

#run a specific rule, like FastQC:
snakemake fastqc_raw --cores 2 --use-conda
```
Use `--use-conda` to ensure all dependencies are managed in isolated environments

### Pipeline Steps
1. **Quality Control & Trimming**: `FastQC` -> `MultiQC` -> `Trimmomatic` (adapter/quality trimming)
2. **Read Alignment**: `HISAT2` map reads to the reference genome.
3. **Indexing/Sorting**: `Salmon`
4. **Quantification**: `featureCounts` to generate read counts
5. **Differential Expression**: `PyDESeq2` Python implementation of DESeq2
6. **Functional Enrichment**: `GProfiler`, `DAVID Bioinformatics`, `GOATOOLS`

## üîß Configuration

Project-specific variables are set in `config/config.yml`. You can modify these values according to your needs.

**Example**:
```yaml
samples:
  - Control_T14_1
  - Control_T14_2
  - Control_T14_3
  - Alternaria_T14_1
  - Alternaria_T14_2

params:
  trimmomatic: "ILLUMINACLIP:resources/adapters/NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10:2:True LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:5:18 MINLEN:30"

references:
  glygenome: "resources/genomes/Gmax_880_v6.0.fa"
  glyannotation: "resources/annotations/Gmax_880_Wm82.a6.v1.gene.gff3"


**params**:
trimmomatic: "ILLUMINACLIP:resources/adapters/NexteraPE-PE.fa:2:30:10:2:True LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:5:18 MINLEN:30"

**references**:
  glygenome: "resources/genomes/Gmax_880_v6.0.fa"
  glyannotation: "resources/annotations/Gmax_880_Wm82.a6.v1.gene.gff3"
```
- **Samples**: You can add new samples in this list, making sure they match the expected naming convention.
- **Params**: Adjust trimming parameters here if needed (for example, changing adapter files or quality filtering criteria).
- **References**: Make sure the genome and annotation files are correctly placed in the `resources/` folder. See the **Data Sources** section for more info.

## üìä Data Sources
- **Raw Reads**: Generated in Cassone's Lab, Department of Biology, Brandon University
- **Reference Genomes & Annotations**: Downloaded from Phytozome. See the download link below.
